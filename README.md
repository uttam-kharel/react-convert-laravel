# Shubham International Hospital — Laravel + Livewire (Vercel Deployment)

> **Live at:** **https://react-convert-laravel.vercel.app** ✅ &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Custom domain:** **https://v2.sih.com.np** *(attached & verified in Vercel — just add the Cloudflare CNAME per* [`VERCEL-V2-SETUP.md`](VERCEL-V2-SETUP.md) *step 5 and it goes live)*

This is a **Laravel 13 + Livewire 4** hospital website (public site + admin panel) deployed to
**Vercel serverless functions** using the community `vercel-php` runtime. This README documents
**everything that was done** so the exact setup can be replicated on another project.

## 1. What this project is

- **Stack:** Laravel 13.16, Livewire 4.3, Blade, Tailwind CSS v4 via Vite, SQLite locally.
- **Public pages** (all Livewire page components in `app/Livewire/Pages/`): Home, Services,
  Doctors, Departments, Blogs, Health Packages, Gallery, Careers, Contact, Appointment, CMS pages.
- **Admin panel** at `/admin` guarded by `auth:admin` (custom `Authenticate` middleware +
  `AdminUser` model). ~20 resources (doctors, services, blogs, gallery, testimonials, FAQs,
  job openings, menus, settings, admin users…) share one generic Livewire
  `admin::resource-manager` component.
- **Data:** content lives in **SQLite** (`database/database.sqlite`, ~35 tables, full content).
  On Vercel this file is uploaded as-is and served **read-only** — pages render with real data.
- The site is deployed on branch `main` via the Vercel CI/CD workflow.

---

## 2. How the Vercel deployment works

Vercel runs PHP code as **serverless functions**. Laravel is deployed as a single function whose
entrypoint is `api/index.php`. A rewrite in `vercel.json` sends **every** request to that function,
and `api/index.php` simply reuses Laravel's normal front controller (`public/index.php`) — exactly
like `php artisan serve`, but on Vercel's infrastructure.

```
Browser → https://<project>.vercel.app/        (or the custom domain once attached)
              ▼  (vercel.json route "/(.*)" → /api/index.php)
         api/index.php   (reset SCRIPT_NAME, point caches at /tmp, require public/index.php)
              ▼  (require public/index.php → boots Laravel, handles the request)
         Laravel routes (Livewire) → HTML / JSON
```

### The three serverless constraints that shape this setup

| Constraint | Consequence | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Read-only filesystem** (only `/tmp` is writable) | Laravel caches/logs/sessions can't write to `storage/` | `api/index.php` points every cache + compiled views at `/tmp` via `putenv` |
| **PHP runtime reports `SCRIPT_NAME` as `/api/index.php`** | Laravel treats `/api` as the base URL and strips it from every path → all routes 404 | `api/index.php` resets `SCRIPT_NAME`/`PHP_SELF` to `/index.php` |
| **Vercel proxies HTTPS at the edge** | Laravel sees `http://` internally and generates `http://` asset URLs → browsers block mixed content, CSS dies | `bootstrap/app.php` adds `$middleware->trustProxies(at: '*')` |
| **Vite dev artifacts can ship** | `public/hot` makes `@vite` render `localhost:5173` links → no CSS | `.vercelignore` excludes `/public/hot` |
| **No build step on Vercel** (`framework: null`) | Compiled frontend isn't generated remotely | Run `npm run build` locally so `public/build/` uploads with the deploy |

---

## 3. The deployment files

### 3a. `api/index.php` — the Vercel PHP entrypoint

```php
<?php

/*
 * Vercel entrypoint for Laravel (vercel-php runtime).
 *
 * Every request is rewritten here by vercel.json, then handed to Laravel's
 * normal front controller (public/index.php) — exactly like `php artisan serve`.
 */

// The PHP runtime reports SCRIPT_NAME as /api/index.php; Laravel derives its
// base URL from it and would strip /api from every path (all routes 404).
// Reset it so Laravel sees the real URLs.
$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] = '/index.php';
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] = '/index.php';

// Vercel Functions run on a read-only filesystem (only /tmp is writable), so
// point every file-based cache at /tmp and log to stderr (Vercel Function Logs).
// Each is guarded so an explicit env var set in the Vercel dashboard wins.
if (!getenv('APP_CONFIG_CACHE'))    putenv('APP_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/config.php');
if (!getenv('APP_ROUTES_CACHE'))    putenv('APP_ROUTES_CACHE=/tmp/routes-v7.php');
if (!getenv('APP_EVENTS_CACHE'))    putenv('APP_EVENTS_CACHE=/tmp/events.php');
if (!getenv('APP_PACKAGES_CACHE'))  putenv('APP_PACKAGES_CACHE=/tmp/packages.php');
if (!getenv('APP_SERVICES_CACHE'))  putenv('APP_SERVICES_CACHE=/tmp/services.php');
if (!getenv('VIEW_COMPILED_PATH'))  putenv('VIEW_COMPILED_PATH=/tmp/views');
if (!getenv('LOG_CHANNEL'))         putenv('LOG_CHANNEL=stderr');
if (!getenv('SESSION_DRIVER'))      putenv('SESSION_DRIVER=cookie');
if (!getenv('CACHE_STORE'))         putenv('CACHE_STORE=array');
if (!getenv('QUEUE_CONNECTION'))    putenv('QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync');

require __DIR__.'/../public/index.php';
```

| Line | Why it exists |
|---|---|
| `SCRIPT_NAME` / `PHP_SELF` → `/index.php` | Without it, Laravel derives `baseUrl = /api` from `SCRIPT_NAME=/api/index.php` and strips `/api` from **every** path → all routes 404. |
| `APP_CONFIG_CACHE` … `APP_SERVICES_CACHE` → `/tmp` | Read-only filesystem would break Laravel when it tries to write cached config/routes/events/packages/services files. `/tmp` is writable. |
| `VIEW_COMPILED_PATH` → `/tmp/views` | Compiled Blade views must be written somewhere writable. |
| `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr` | Logs to the function's stderr, which appears in **Vercel Function Logs**. |
| `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie` | Database/file sessions can't work (read-only + ephemeral). Cookie sessions persist in the browser and survive cold starts. |
| `CACHE_STORE=array` | In-memory cache per-request — no persistence needed for a serverless site. |
| `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` | Jobs run inline instead of needing a queue worker. |
| `getenv()` guards | A value set in the Vercel dashboard **overrides** these defaults. |

### 3b. `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "version": 2,
  "framework": null,
  "outputDirectory": "public",
  "functions": {
    "api/index.php": {
      "runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.4",
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/build/(.*)",
      "dest": "/build/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.php"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `"framework": null` | Tells Vercel **not** to auto-detect a framework. Without this, Vercel sees the Vite `package.json` and tries to run `npm run build` → fails because `vendor/` isn't present during the build. |
| `"outputDirectory": "public"` | Satisfies Vercel's build output check and marks `public/` as the static output. |
| `"functions"` → `runtime: "vercel-php@0.7.4"` | The community PHP runtime. **0.7.4 = PHP 8.3** (matches this project's `composer.json` `"php": "^8.3"`). See the ⚠️ note below about **why not 0.9.0**. |
| `"maxDuration": 30` | Function execution limit. |
| `"routes"` → `/build/(.*)` → `/build/$1` | Serves compiled Vite assets (in `public/build/`) statically from Vercel's edge. **Must come before the catch-all** or CSS requests get swallowed by PHP and 404. |
| `"routes"` → `/(.*)` → `/api/index.php` | The catch-all rewrite that sends every request to the Laravel function. |

> ⚠️ **Why `vercel-php@0.7.4` and not `0.9.0`?** (This was the hardest bug in this deployment.)
> A fresh build with `vercel-php@0.9.0` **succeeds** (composer installs, `Creating lambda`,
> `Build Completed`) but **every request 500s** with:
> `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/launcher.launcher' imported from /opt/rust/nodejs.js`
> The 0.9.0 builder produces a broken function bundle on Vercel's current infrastructure when
> the lambda is built **fresh**. (The other project, `laravel-vercel`, still used 0.9.0 and worked
> **only because** each deploy restored a **build cache** containing a pre-built lambda.)
> **Fix:** pin `vercel-php@0.7.4` (PHP 8.3 — a stable, widely-deployed version) and redeploy.
> The runtime change forces a fresh, correctly-built lambda. Verified live.

> 🎨 **Assets:** `framework: null` means Vercel runs **no** build step, so the compiled frontend
> is **not** generated remotely. Run `npm run build` locally before deploying — it creates
> `public/build/` (manifest + compiled CSS/fonts) which uploads with the deploy.

### 3c. `.vercelignore`

```gitignore
# Vercel re-installs Composer dependencies during the build.
/vendor

# Local development files — never upload.
/.freebuff
/.env
/.env.local
/node_modules
/tests
/.git
/.kilo
/.github
/php-dev.ini

# Local runtime artifacts (logs, compiled views, caches).
/storage/logs
/storage/framework/cache
/storage/framework/sessions
/storage/framework/views

# Vite dev-mode marker — never upload. Its presence makes @vite render links
# to the dev server (localhost:5173) and break CSS.
/public/hot

# public/storage is a symlink to storage/app/public — breaks on Vercel.
/public/storage

# NOTE: database/database.sqlite is intentionally NOT ignored — it carries the
# site's content (read-only on Vercel) so the pages render with real data.
```

| Entry | Why |
|---|---|
| `/vendor` | Vercel re-installs Composer dependencies during the build itself. |
| `/.env`, `/.env.local`, `/.freebuff`, `/node_modules`, `/tests`, `/.git`, `/.kilo`, `/.github`, `/php-dev.ini` | Local/development/host-only files that must never ship. |
| `/storage/*` | Local runtime artifacts (logs, caches) — regenerated or redirected to `/tmp` at runtime. |
| `/public/hot` | A 17-byte Vite **dev-mode** marker. If uploaded, `@vite` renders `localhost:5173` links instead of built assets → CSS silently breaks. |
| `/public/storage` | Symlink to `storage/app/public` — broken on Vercel's filesystem. |
| *(kept)* `database/database.sqlite` | **Intentionally uploaded.** It holds all the site's content. Vercel serves it read-only, so pages render with real data. |

### 3d. `bootstrap/app.php` — one addition

```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    // Trust Vercel's edge proxy so Laravel sees the original https scheme
    // (X-Forwarded-Proto) and generates https:// asset/route URLs instead
    // of http:// ones (otherwise browsers block assets as mixed content).
    $middleware->trustProxies(at: '*');

    $middleware->alias([
        'auth' => \App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
    ]);
})
```

**Why:** without `trustProxies(at: '*')`, the homepage's `<link rel="stylesheet">` renders as
`http://<project>.vercel.app/...` (plain HTTP), which Chrome blocks as **mixed content** — CSS dead
even though the files exist. With trustProxies set, everything renders as `https://`.

---

## 4. Production environment variables

Set on Vercel → project **react-convert-laravel** → **Settings → Environment Variables**
(for the **Production** environment). All are marked **Sensitive/Encrypted**.

| Variable | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_KEY` | (from local `.env`, a `base64:...` value) | Laravel encryption key — must match local so existing content works. |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` | Production mode. |
| `APP_DEBUG` | `false` | Hide stack traces. |
| `APP_URL` | `https://v2.sih.com.np` | Canonical URL for absolute-URL generation. |
| `SESSION_DRIVER` | `cookie` | Serverless-safe sessions (persist in the browser). |
| `CACHE_STORE` | `array` | No persistent cache needed. |
| `QUEUE_CONNECTION` | `sync` | Jobs run inline. |
| `LOG_CHANNEL` | `stderr` | Logs appear in Vercel Function Logs. |
| `DB_CONNECTION` | `sqlite` | Uses the uploaded `database/database.sqlite` (read-only). |

CLI equivalent (from the project folder, after `vercel login` / `vercel link`):

```bash
echo "base64:...your-key..." | vercel env add APP_KEY production
echo "production"             | vercel env add APP_ENV production
echo "false"                  | vercel env add APP_DEBUG production
echo "https://v2.sih.com.np"  | vercel env add APP_URL production
echo "cookie"                 | vercel env add SESSION_DRIVER production
echo "array"                  | vercel env add CACHE_STORE production
echo "sync"                   | vercel env add QUEUE_CONNECTION production
echo "stderr"                 | vercel env add LOG_CHANNEL production
echo "sqlite"                 | vercel env add DB_CONNECTION production
```

> 💡 **CLI gotcha:** do **not** append `</dev/null` to these `echo | vercel env add` pipelines —
> the null redirect overrides the pipe and the values are silently dropped (verified in this
> deployment — the env vars had to be re-added without it).

---

## 5. Deploying (step by step)

### Option A — Deploy without git (Vercel CLI) — **what was used here**

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI (or use `npx vercel` everywhere instead)
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Log in (device flow: open the printed URL, authorize)
vercel login

# 3. From the project folder, link to a (new) project
vercel link --yes

# 4. Set production env vars (see §4)

# 5. Make sure compiled assets exist (no remote build step!)
npm run build

# 6. Deploy to production
vercel --prod --yes
```

### Fix the framework auto-detection (only needed once, per project)

If the first deploy fails with a Vite-related error (e.g. `Could not resolve ...` while running
`npm run build`, or `No Output Directory named 'dist' found`), the project was auto-detected as
**Vite**. `vercel.json` already declares `framework: null`, but Vercel's *project settings* may
still carry the detected defaults. Fix it via the API:

```bash
TOKEN=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.local/share/com.vercel.cli/auth.json','utf8')).token)")
curl -s -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"framework":null,"outputDirectory":"public","buildCommand":"","devCommand":""}' \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/livewire-app?teamId=<YOUR_TEAM_ID>"
```

(Find `teamId`/`projectId` in `.vercel/project.json`.) Dashboard alternative:
**Settings → Build & Development Settings → Framework Preset: Other → Output Directory: `public`.**

### Option B — Deploy with git (GitHub import)

1. `git init && git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git remote add origin <repo> && git push -u origin main`
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new, import the GitHub repo.
3. Set **Framework Preset: Other** and **Output Directory: public** if the import mis-detects Vite.
4. Add the env vars from §4 in the dashboard (Production).
5. Push to the branch → auto-deploys. The `vercel.json` `functions` config makes the PHP function work.

---

## 6. Custom domain (v2.sih.com.np)

**`v2.sih.com.np`** (DNS on **Cloudflare**) is the **custom domain** of this project.
**Current state (2026-08-02):**

| Step | Status |
|---|---|
| New Vercel project `react-convert-laravel` created (`prj_Jn68MIQIDMy31sApwUsp69wx44xs`) | ✅ done |
| Production deploy → `https://react-convert-laravel.vercel.app` (home + `/up` + `/admin/login` = 200) | ✅ done |
| Production env vars set (`APP_URL=https://v2.sih.com.np`, `APP_KEY`, `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie`, `CACHE_STORE=array`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`, `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr`, `APP_DEBUG=false`) | ✅ done |
| GitHub Actions secrets (`VERCEL_TOKEN`/`VERCEL_ORG_ID`/`VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`) | ✅ done — CI/CD deploys on push to `main` |
| Domain `v2.sih.com.np` attached to the new project (verified: true) | ✅ done |
| Cloudflare CNAME `v2` → `cname.vercel-dns.com` (DNS only) | ⏳ **user step — add it and v2.sih.com.np goes live** |

> **One remaining step:** in Cloudflare (zone `sih.com.np`) add a **CNAME** record
> `v2` → `cname.vercel-dns.com` with proxy set to **DNS only** (grey cloud). Vercel then issues
> the TLS certificate automatically and `https://v2.sih.com.np` serves this project.

### Vercel side

1. **Vercel → Project → Settings → Domains → Add** → `v2.sih.com.np`.
2. Vercel shows the DNS target: **`cname.vercel-dns.com`** (plus a TXT record if verification is needed).

### Cloudflare side

Add a **CNAME** record in Cloudflare (zone `sih.com.np`):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `CNAME` |
| **Name** | `v2` |
| **Target** | `cname.vercel-dns.com` |
| **Proxy status** | ⚪ **DNS only** (grey cloud — NOT orange/proxied) |
| **TTL** | `Auto` |

> ⚠️ **Proxy status must be "DNS only"** (grey cloud). If proxied (orange cloud), Cloudflare hides
> the CNAME behind its own IPs and Vercel's SSL certificate validation fails.

> `v1.sih.com.np` already exists as a CNAME to the same target on this zone; `v1` and `v2` are
> different hostnames, so both can point at Vercel side by side (each to its own project).

**Why "DNS only":** if the record is proxied (orange cloud), Cloudflare hides the CNAME behind
its own IPs and Vercel's certificate validation can fail.

> Apex note: `sih.com.np` itself would need an **A record → `76.76.21.21`** instead of a CNAME.

---

## 7. Known limitations on Vercel

| Limitation | Detail | Real fix |
|---|---|---|
| **SQLite is read-only** | The uploaded `database/database.sqlite` can be **read** (pages render with real content) but **cannot be written**. **Admin CRUD saves, appointments, contact submissions, and job applications will 500** with `attempt to write a readonly database`. | Connect a real database (Neon/Supabase Postgres): set `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` + `DB_URL`, run `php artisan migrate --force`, then session/cache can also move to DB. |
| **Cookie sessions ≈ 4KB cap** | Livewire admin pages with image uploads (gallery, doctors, blogs) store temporary upload metadata in the session; cookie payloads over ~4KB silently fail. | Use DB-backed sessions once Postgres is connected. |
| **No remote build step** | Frontend changes require `npm run build` locally before deploying. | (By design — `framework: null`.) |

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Cannot find module '/var/task/launcher.launcher' imported from /opt/rust/nodejs.js` on **every** request (500), even though the build succeeded | `vercel-php@0.9.0` fresh builds produce a broken function bundle on current Vercel infra | Pin `vercel-php@0.7.4` in `vercel.json` and redeploy (forces a fresh, working lambda) |
| Build runs `npm run build` / `vite build` and fails | Vercel auto-detected the Vite framework | `framework: null` in `vercel.json` + PATCH project settings (`framework:null`, `buildCommand:""`, `outputDirectory:public`) |
| `No Output Directory named 'dist' found` | Same framework detection, `outputDirectory: dist` default | Set `outputDirectory: public` in `vercel.json` and/or project settings |
| All `/` routes 404 (Laravel treats `/api` as base URL) | `SCRIPT_NAME` reported as `/api/index.php` | `api/index.php` resets `SCRIPT_NAME`/`PHP_SELF` to `/index.php` |
| Homepage renders but CSS is missing / unstyled in Chrome | (a) `public/hot` shipped → `@vite` renders `localhost:5173` links; (b) assets served as `http://` → mixed-content block | (a) `.vercelignore` excludes `/public/hot`; (b) `trustProxies(at: '*')` in `bootstrap/app.php` |
| Admin/contact/appointment save → 500 `attempt to write a readonly database` | Read-only SQLite on Vercel | Connect Postgres (`DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` + `DB_URL`) — see §7 |
| Where do I see errors? | — | Vercel dashboard → project → **Logs**, or `vercel logs <deployment-url>` (logs go to stderr via `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr`) |
| `vercel env add` values seem dropped | `</dev/null` on the pipeline overrode the `echo` pipe | Run `echo "value" | vercel env add KEY production` without the null redirect |

---

## 9. Replicating on another project

1. **Copy the four pieces:** `api/index.php`, `vercel.json`, `.vercelignore`, and the
   `trustProxies(at: '*')` line in `bootstrap/app.php`.
2. **Pin the runtime:** keep `"runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.4"` (PHP 8.3) — do **not** bump to 0.9.0
   without testing a fresh build.
3. **Ship your data:** if you want content without a DB, keep `database/database.sqlite`
   un-ignored (read-only on Vercel). For a write-capable site, use Postgres instead.
4. **Build assets locally:** run `npm run build` so `public/build/` uploads.
5. **Env vars:** see §4 (always `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie`,
   `CACHE_STORE=array`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`, `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr`).
6. **Deploy:** `vercel login && vercel link --yes && vercel --prod --yes`.
7. **Custom domain:** attach via dashboard/API, set `APP_URL`, add the matching Cloudflare CNAME
   (DNS-only), and let Vercel issue the SSL cert.

*Generated documentation for the `refactors` branch deployment. The site was verified live on
2026-07-31: all public routes + `/up` + `/admin/login` return 200, assets served over `https://`.*
